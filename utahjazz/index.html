<h2>Spotlight: The Legacy of the Utah Jazz</h2>

<p>
Founded in 1974,
the team moved to Utah in 1979 and has built a strong basketball tradition.
Some of the greatest players in NBA history, including Karl Malone and John Stockton,
helped lead the Jazz to multiple NBA Finals appearances in the 1990s.

The team is known for its passionate fans and strong home-court advantage at
the Delta Center in Salt Lake City. The Jazz continue to compete at a high level
