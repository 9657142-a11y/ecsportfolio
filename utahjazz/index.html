    <h1>The World of the Utah Jazz</h1>

    <h2>Spotlight: The Legacy of Karl Malone</h2>
    <p>
        Karl Malone, known as "The Mailman," is one of the greatest players in Utah Jazz history. 
        Alongside point guard John Stockton, Malone helped lead the Jazz to two NBA Finals appearances 
        in 1997 and 1998. His scoring ability, strength, and consistency made him one of the most 
        dominant power forwards the league has ever seen.
